## STATIC PAGE
# This represents a static webpage on the website, such as the Front Page, the Articles index, the Contact,
# or certain other pages which will not be removed from the site in the foreseeable future.
# This model allows us to define the content for those static pages in the CMS instead of hardcoding them in HTML/Slim files.
#
# There are a set number of static pages which are defined by the "role" enum, there should only ever be one static page for each role.
